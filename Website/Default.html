            X-Mouse Controls</h1>
        <p>
            A tool to enable or disable active window tracking, raising and also the delay in
            milliseconds. This is known as x-mouse behavior.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What is x-mouse behavior?</h2>
        <p>
            When multiple programs are running on a Windows operating system, the default mode
            of operations is that you click one window after another to give them focus for
            keyboard inputs. With the x-mouse settings that click is not necessary - the only
            thing needed is to move your cursor over the window for it to become active.
        </p>
        <p>
            This behavior has been possible, but disabled, in different versions of Windows
            for years. It is usually enabled through a wide variety of tools, most notably Tweak
            UI found in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx">
                Microsoft PowerToys</a>. However, Tweak UI does not run on Windows Vista.</p>

                    Enable to give focus to windows by moving your cursor over them. Obeys the delay
                    described below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If disabled (default) a click is required to activate a window.

                    Enable to automatically make the active window the topmost window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If automatic window raising is disabled (default) it allows the user to type text
                    or give commands in one window without changing the order of the other windows.

                <p>
                    The delay, in milliseconds, until the window focus changes. This program allows
                    settings from 0 milliseconds (instant focus) to 5000 milliseconds (very long delay).

                <p>
                    Saves the settings and applies them to your system. While the settings should come
                    in effect right away, some users have reported that logging off or rebooting is
                    required.

            Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes to the x-mouse behavior may not come in effect until logging off or rebooting.</li>
            <li>Some applications, especially those with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_document_interface">
                Multiple Document Interface</a>, may raise their own window even though the feature
                is disabled. See work-around below.</li>
            <li>Some menus do not like the x-mouse behavior and close before you are able to reach
                or click any menu alternative. See work-around below.</li>
            <li>One way to avoid window raising and menu problems is to click and hold your left
                mouse button on an empty (unresponsive) area, drag the cursor to where you want
                to focus and let go.</li>
            <li>Requires at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_3.0#.NET_Framework_3.5">
                .NET Framework 3.5</a> due to the fact that this was a small test to try out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">
                    Windows Presentation Foundation.</a></li>
            <li>Developed on Windows Vista Business 64 bit with Visual Studio 2008. Developed for
                Windows Vista, both 32 bit and 64 bit. If you use a version of Windows released
                prior to Windows Vista, it is recommended to use Tweak UI, found in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx">
                    Microsoft PowerToys</a>.</li>
